# **Verb-Metaphor-detection**

This is the code for paper [Combining the Attention Network and Semantic Representation for Chinese Verb Metaphor Identification] IEEE Access

## Run

the code can be run under py3.5&keras	2.24

run "python run.py" can get the results

the data should be split and saved as './splitt.pkl'

the text data is saved in './Total.txt'

'word2vec_synonym_30' can be trained by [train_synonym_word_embedding.py](https://github.com/Xikai-Liu/Verb-Metaphor-detection/blob/master/train_synonym_word_embedding.py)

hgdtyc.txt contains the Synonym information

## Paper

In this paper, synonyms are used to enhance the deep meaning of the text, so as to enhance the recognition effect of verb metaphorical sentences.
